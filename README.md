# RESTful-API-with-laravel-Sanctum
Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services. REST API is a way of accessing web services in a simple and flexible way without having any processing.

Here is a simple and secure REST API build in Laravel 10 with the help of the Laravel sanctum package.
The application has also been undergone step by step  testing  using the Postman testing tool.
